Controlling Bean Selections
    @Primary - to set one bean as primary when we have multiple beans
    @Qualifier - specifying a specific bean


Externalizing configurations (application.properties):
    This part explains how to get the value from application.properties
    in order to access any parameter from the application.properties we need to use
    the @Value("${parameterName}") annotation.

    #   we can also set a default value to a parameter even if they are not declare on
        the application.properties

            @Value("${stripe.timeout:3000}")
            private Double timeOut;

        Here if there is no such property declared as stripe.timeout; the system will work
        with the default one. But if there is one, spring boot will overwrite that onw
        with the default one.

Externalizing configurations (application.yaml):
    both .yaml and .properties are configuration files and both can exist individually. But
    it's better to follow only one configuration file so I am deleting application.properties file
